##This speech recognition system is designed to accurately transcribe spoken language into text using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning Techniques. The system leverages pre-trained models and modern frameworks to ensure real-time, high accuracy speech-to-text conversion with applications in voice assistants, automated transcription services, and accessibility tools, this system enables efficient human-computer interaction through voice commands and dictation.

##Features

**Real-time speech-to-text** :Converst spoken words into text efficiently.

**Noise reduction & filtering** :Ensures clarity even in noisy environments.

**Customizable model** :Fine-tune or extend functionalities with additional training.

**Integration with API's** :Comaptible with google speech-to-text, whisper, and deepspeech models.

**Speaker Identification** :Detects different speakers in audio conversations.

##Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshiniryali/SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM.git
cd SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

##Usage

Run the tool with an audio file:
python recognize.py --audio "sample.wav"

##How it works?

**Preprocessing** :Cleans and normalizes audio input.
**Feature Extraction** :Uses MFCC's, Mel Spectrograms, or Wave2Vec embeddings.
**Speech Model Processing** :Transcribes speech using deep learning models like Whisper, DeepSpeech, or Wave2Vec.
**Post-processing** :Enhances readability by formatting text output.
